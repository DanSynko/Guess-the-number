# Guess the number

This project was my first pet-project on C++. Here I learned about the `<random>` library and some functions for error-checking.

This project was created as a learning exercise to practice C++ programming skills. It is a simple console-based To-Do list application.

## What I learned while working on the project:

*  ** "random" library instead of rand():** How it works and how to work with it.
*  **OOP:** The first version of the project was written in the procedural paradigm. Then i rewrote it using OOP and writing the logic of project before the main().
*  **Input Validation and Error Handling:** Learned mechanisms for validating user input and processing errors.


## Technologies
*  **Language:** C++20.
*  **IDE:** Visual Studio 2022.
