"Guess the number" was my first pet-project on C++. Here I learned about the `<random>` library and some functions for error-checking. At first, I had written it using the procedural paradigm. Then I rewrote it using OOP.

In my pet projects, I use AI for error-finding and solutions, but I try to solve them myself.

(now my English-level is not good so i use AI for this too, i apologise)
